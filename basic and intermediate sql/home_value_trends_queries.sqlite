Intermediate Challenge

	-- What is the percent change 7 in average home values from 2007 to 2017 by state? How about from 1997 to 		2017?
		Hint: We can use the WITH clause to create temporary tables containing the average home values for each of those years, then join them together to compare the change over time.
	-- How would you describe the trend in home values for each state from 1997 to 2017? How about from 2007 to 	2017? Which states would you recommend for making real estate investments?
